# LiveScoreDisplaySystem
It is a live score display system software. It is coded in C++ language. For a cricket match score can be calculated using this software, Here score means a score of an individual as well as overall, etc. It is a foreground process that needs to be run during the match and needs to enter input according to match. I used STL to make it simpler
